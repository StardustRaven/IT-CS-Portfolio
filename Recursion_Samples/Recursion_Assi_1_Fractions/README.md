# Recursive Fraction Sum (LCM)

## Overview
This project calculates the sum of multiple fractions using recursion. The program accepts numerators and denominators as command-line arguments, finds a common denominator using the least common multiple (LCM), and produces a simplified fractional result.

The focus of this project is on using recursion to break down a multi-step mathematical process into smaller, manageable operations.

## Concepts Demonstrated
- Recursive processing of command-line arguments
- Least common multiple (LCM) calculation
- Fraction normalization and reduction
- Integer arithmetic and modular logic
- Input validation and error handling

## Implementation Notes
- Fractions are processed recursively rather than iteratively, reinforcing how recursion can replace traditional loops.
- The program computes a common denominator before adjusting numerators, ensuring correctness when summing multiple fractions.
- Care is taken to validate inputs and avoid invalid arithmetic operations.
- The design emphasizes clarity of logic over optimization.

## Reflection
This project helped solidify how recursion can be applied beyond textbook examples and used to manage real computational steps. It also reinforced the importance of validating inputs and handling edge cases when working with numerical data.
